Before-the-Trip Planning

Travels require at least these elements:

1)  The destiation, or an idea of where you are going.
Determining the destination before hand will help you with the planning greatly and can save you money.  What you should do is

- Decide which cities to visit. 
- Look up friends to see if you have any long lost relatives or friends that you can crash for a few nights, and contact them.
- Do some research about places to go in these cities.  Don't sweat too much about this.  You can easily get overwhelmed at the list of new names, new places, new things to try.  Too many new things!  I bought the Lonely Planet "Europe on a Shoestring" book, which is a very good general guide for all the countries within Europe.  Even though the book is quite general, still, I got overwhelmed.  I usually read about the country, then picked out a city that fits my trip, and went there.  The book supplied me some general ideas, but once I was in the city, the book made a lot more sense.
- Based on the destinations, decide with EURail pass to purchase.  The Eurails pass can be expensive, but it's still cheaper than buying each train tickets individually.



3)  Time
You will need to work out the time when it is possible.  Europe can be expensive during high traffic seasons, but if you can line up your trip with events, then by all means, go and enjoy.  Also, being young working professional in the U.S. means you have about 2 to 3 weeks of vacation for the entire year.  This means you will have to make sacrifice to be able to travel for an extended amount of time.  

For me, I quit my job so I had all the time in the world to travel -- and this makes the trip more enjoyable.  I wasn't under any pressure to have to "pack" the traveling as much as possible into a few weeks.  I was happy with just the trip itself.  Traveling under time-pressure is probably the worst way to enjoy your vacation.  I learned this when I was in Rome, Italy.  I got to the city the night before and had only one full day explore the city, and I had to rush around.  I'd spend at least 2 to 3 nights in a city.  Having 2 full days to go around is much better than jam-pack everything into 1 single day and take off the morning after.  

2)  Money.  You need to save up enough to be able to afford the trip.  Expenses include flights or trains tickets to or within Europe, food, lodging, entrance fees for museums, attractions, emergency funds, etc.

I got my 3-week round-trip ticket for around $580 to fly from Chicago O'Hare to Paris Charles de Gaule.  This price was quite cheap, but again, this was September, not a heavy traveling season.  Since I didn't buy the EURails pass, I had to buy individual train passes to each city.  On average, an international train ticket (e.g. Amsterdam to Berlin) would cost 80€ - 110€, while domestic tickets are a bit cheaper.  My Venice to Rome train ticket cost 65€.

If you travel on a budget, besides crashing at friends' places, hostels are your friend.  European hostels cost about 25€ to 40€ per night.  I did not find any hostels at 15€, but if you have time to research and shop around, you may find good deals.  I was lucky to have old friends and relative, so I didn't have to spend money on hostels for almost 2 weeks out of 3.  Now it's the time to contact your friends and ask them for a favor.  You will rekindle the friendship, have good conversation, and save tons of money.  But if you have to pay for a bed, don't cringe your nose. It's well worth it.

Musems entrance fees usually cost from 8€ to 15€.
Meals cost about 10€ (basic: 1 main dish and a bottle of water) to 20€ (if you want something more fancy).
Postcards cost anywhere from 0.50€ to 2€, and stamps cost around 0.65€ to 1€ for international.  I sent about 20+ cards to friends, but the money and efforts were well worth it.

4)  Health
No ages are too old to travel.  But it sucks to be 70 years old and carry a 30lbs backpack everywhere for weeks.  There are easy access to cars and most of the time you have to rely on public transporations, so a good stamina will help you enjoy your trip better.

Watch out for common sickness:  cold, running stomache, motion sickness.  Since you will be sweating a lot while walking, watch out for sudden drops of temparature or strong winds.  You may catch a cold and it will take some time to fully recover.  

When I was in Amsterdam, the temparature suddenly dropped to below 50F, and I did not have a sweater on.  I was a bit ignorance in the morning and did not check the weather before hand.  A day later I started to feel the cold hitting.  Good thing I took preemptive measures by taking cold medicines, drinking lots of water and vitamin C juices, and continue walking.  The cold didn't stay for too long.  But I learned from the experience:  an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, espcially you have to rely on your good health when you're traveling.

I did not experience any upset stomache for the entire trip, which proves that Europe is not any dirtier than the US.  If people tell you "so and so in Europe is dirty", just ignore the ignorants.  I ate raw herring, and loved it.  One day in Amsterdam, all I ate were fish and fish sandwiches:  raw herrings for breakfast, herring sandwich for lunch, and smoked cod sandwich for dinner.  Nonetheless, bring some anti-diarrheal medicine, you may need it.  In general, you should get an imergency medicine kit.  I bought mine at REI for $10, and also got peace of mind.  What a bargain!

Get a good insurance as well.  I bought the WorldNomad insurance for 3 weeks, and glad that I didn't have to use it.
