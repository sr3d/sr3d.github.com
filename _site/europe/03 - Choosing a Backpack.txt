Since you have to pack your life inside a bag and carry it for an extended amount of time, a good pack is very important to the success of your trip.  The most important principle for packing is to pack light, and then pack lighter.  Everything that you bring along, think ahead to see if you really need it in the next few weeks.  If you want to bring it "just-in-case", then don't.  Europe does have convenient stores and supermarket around the corner.  You may have to pay a bit more to buy things in Europe, but for the convenience and the weight you can save, the money is worth it.


Choosing a backpack
===================
Even though I'm a regular online shopper, I chose to go to a real store to try out the backpack.  I wanted to make sure I could wear the backpack, and heard the professional opinions and tips of the sales person.  I didn't regret this decision.  It was money well-spent.  

From the beginning, I already decided to not use the rolling suitcase.  The rolling suitecase maybe convenient, and lighter, but in terms of mobility, the backpack is much more flexible (if chosen and packed right).  

The backpack will have to fit you physically.  If you are short, such as myself (I'm 5'4"), you should only get small to medium backpack at most.  One of the most important thing you should look into the backpack is the waist support.  Modern packs are designed to shift the weight of the content into the lower back, relieving the weight off your shoulders.  Thus, the waist support band is critical to make sure the pack can rest comfortably on your lower back.  The band, after buckled up, should be right above your pelvis, or hip bone.  The hip bone is to support the band, which in turns stablizes the weight and keep backpack close to your lower backbone.  The shoulderstraps then should wrap around your shoulders fittingly to help stablize the upper part of the backpack.  If the bag is too long, the shoulderstraps won't be able to reach out and wrap around you, and you will feel wobblying when carrying the pack.  

I went to the local REI store and had a very good conversation with the sales person at the time.  He spent a good half an hour helping me pick out a backpack and explained how to pick a good one.  I took one of his advices, which was to pick the pack with frontal access, instead of top-loading only.  I chose a small Gregory z65 back for about $240 (ouch!), which has a super convenient zip-up front-panel that allows me to access the bottom of the backpack anytime.  Since most of my jeans were packed at the bottom, being able to reach in and take one out at anytime was so convenient that I forgot I spent a great chump of change for the pack.   If all things are equal, pick the back with front-access.  You won't regret it.

I also asked the salesman to stuff the bags with some weight and walked the store for a while.  I am still very impressed of how Gregory designed the backpack.  

The best way to choose a backpack is to actually try it on, with real weight, for about 20 minutes, to see if you are comfortable with it.  Pay attention to how your shoulders feel, and how the weight is shifted to your lowerback.  Remember, you will have to carry the backpack for a few hours, if not for the entire day (you may miss a connection somewhere and end up having no hostels!), so pick a new backpack if you don't feel comfortable.



Packing your life
=================

I did some research on Google to find out about tips and tricks on how to pack.  There are lots of sites out there telling you how to pack, but it all boils down to rolling up your shirts and t-shirts to reduce wrinkles, even for Jeans.  Using these simple techniques, you can pack quite a bit into a little space, while still having easy access to your warddrobe, or rather, backpack-drobe.

You should have enough clothing to wear for a week, if possible.  Don't spend too much time trying to wash your clothing on the go, since these time are precious -- you could go somewhere to see something, meet someone, or take a rest, instead of washing your clothes in the sink.  You will be sweating a lot in hot, or even cooler months (September, October), from walking and carrying the backpack around, so you should bring at least 1 shirt a day.  Jeans can be reused extensively so you can wear them for at least a few days before having to rotate in a new pair.  You are traveling, nobody would care about a repeating pair of jeans, unless you keep showing the photos with the same clothing over and over again and point it out.  I layered my shirt too, e.g. wearing an undershirt underneath the main shirt to absorb the sweats, and keep my body from exposing too much with direct heat or wind.  If it gets cold, then at least you have another layer of protection.  

If bringing a week worth of clothings seem too much, then you can always buy more at the cities you travel.  They have tourist shirts that cost around 10€, and you can wear it for a day and toss it out (or keep it for souvernir).  This way you will never have to worry about doing laundry during the trip.

You should definitely buy the packing cubes to organize and further compress the clothing articles.  I was very glad to purchase 2 double-sided EagleCreek packing cubes, one big, and one small.  All my shirts and t-shirts were tightly packed into the big cube, while toilettry, chargers and cables, loose-end stuff were stored in the small cube.  

I rolled up all the shirts and were able to fit about 3 to 4 big rolls into one side of the large cube, while stuffing undershirt, socks, briefs and boxers into the remaining space and the other side.  I usually took half an hour to fully pack the big cube from scrach (usually after a major laundry at my friends' places).

To roll up the shirts:  put one or 2 folded shirts (I used the Japanese folding technique) in the middle of the to-be-rolled-up shirt, then fold the 2 sides of the shirt in to cover the center, and roll from the bottom up.  In the end, you will have 1 to 3 days worth of clothing in one single roll.  The same thing for the t-shirts, just button the t-shirt first to keep it in place, then you can roll it up as usual.

For Jeans, just fold them in half, length-wise, then roll them up from the legs.  The Jeans rolls will be fatter, but these will go nicely into the bottom of the sack to help stable the bottom.

Using these simple techniques, I was able to pack 3 weeks of my life into 2 cubes, with a few jeans.  The pros of rolling up shirts like this is that you can pull one roll out to use for the day, without unrolling or scrambling up the rest of your backpack.  Granted if you nested 2, 3 shirts inside the main shirt, you will have to repack the inside after taking out the outer shirt, but it will take you less than 30 seconds to roll them up and stuff back into the packing cube.

Things that I had to buy during the trip.
========================================
- 2 souvernir shirts at Amsterdam
- an umbrella for the only rainy day out of my 3 weeks, also in Amsterdam
- Flat-to-Round plug adapter (or US to Europe adapter).


Things that I would change
==========================
- POCKET bodywash.  I didn't like the POCKET bodywash too much.  The scent is okay, but it was hard to use.  The first time I used it, some of the glue-like soap stuck to my hair and I was walking around Venice with white stuff on my head (which reminds me of the movie "There's something about Mary", that one scene ...)  I'd just buy the trial-size bodywash and shampoo bottles.  

I didn't handwash my clothes so I didn't get to use the POCKET laundry.  However, I'd still bring it the next time, "just-in-case".

- I'd bring a small umbrella.  I used Tote umbrella and really like it.  They also made the micro umbrella, which is super tiny and comes with a lifetime warranty.  (http://www.totes-isotoner.com/product/rain+products/umbrellas/folding+umbrellas/folding+micro+rain+umbrella.do?sortby=ourPicks).  It should fit into your dayback nicely.

- Hand Lotions.  Being a guy, I didn't bother bringing any.  But my fingers were all chapped due to the dry weather, and the skins started to flake out.  Luckily, midway through the trip, my good friend let me borrow her tiny pack of lotion.

- Lips Moisturizer.  My lips started to chapped and it hurt to smile.  1€50 later I was a happy, smiling man.

- Flat-to-Round plug adapter (US to Europe adapter).  I had to buy a cheapo adapter for 1€ at the flea market in Amsterdam.  Just buy one at home to save you the hassle.

- A belt.  I decided to leave my belt home so that I don't have to worry about it at the Airport.  Well, after 2 weeks, my tummy got smaller and the pants started to get dragged down to my lower waist.  

- The Kindle DX.  I'd leave the Kindle DX home.  It was too bulky, and a bit heavy.  Plus I didn't get much time reading, and the iPhone filled in very nicely.

- Combo-lock, preferably TSA-approved.  Some hostels have free lockers, but you will have to either buy or put a deposit to obtain a lock.  Having your own combo-lock is a lot more convenient, and better peace of mind.

- A small tube of extra strenght itch-relief cream.  For bed bugs for insect bites.  You'll thank yourself later.


Things that I won't leave home without
======================================
- My multi-tool
- The compass.  I have a Suunto Core Light Black, which gives me Altitude (wasn't too useful), Barometer, Temparature, and Storm Alarm.  The storm alarm did work once, and it predirected a rain when I was visiting Pere LaChaise cemetery in Paris.  It did shower about 30 minutes after, very light though.  And more importantly, the compass.
- the iPhone
- the extended battery pack for the iPhone
- the emergency medicine kit
- the microfiber towel.  Do as Towelie said, "don't forget to bring your towel!"
- the mini spiral-bound notebook and the pen.  If you are a serious traveler, bring a notebook with you.  You will write down your confirmation numbers, ticket iternary, your email address, your facebook url, your friend's email, your flickr.com account, etc, and tear out the page give it to your new friends.  Or you can draw or sketch the scene around you, as I did when I was sipping capuccino at a corner of the street.
- condoms.  For the possibilities, and enjoy responsibly.
