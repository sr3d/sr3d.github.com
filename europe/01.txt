After some thinking, I quit my job.  I was turning 25 in a few weeks, and for the past 3 years, all I had done was work, work, and more work.  I wanted changes, and to see the more of the world.  Europe was the first destination that popped in my mind.  Why not backpacking Europe?  After a few months of preparation, I was on my way to Europe for the time of my life.

This was the first time I've been traveling by myself for an extended period of time.  I was a bit nervous, and quite not sure if physically I could handle it.  I'm a tiny guy, and the backpack, fully-loaded, seemed to be bigger than my body.  But it turned out, my 3-week in Europe was one of the most exciting time I've had.  I met and talked to quite a few number of people, and I realized that being self-sufficient makes me a lot more confident in myself.  If anything that I gained from the trip, it is self-confidence, self-reliance, and a more open mind to the possibilities.

I consulted some friends, who had done backpacking before.  They gave me some tips and general advices about the planning and finance.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money.  I worked and saved up a small sum of cash, but I didn't want to spend them all away in a few weeks.  Plus I had other big plans after returning from Europe.  Financially speaking, it is about $1,000 per week for traveling in Europe.  If you travel for 3 weeks, prepare to save up at least $3,000.  To be on the safe-side, you should save up a bit more to compensate for the exchange rate.  At the time of my traveling, 1e equals to $1.48 to $1.50, plus commission.  Ouch!

I then went shopping around for backpacks.  I decided to go with a backpack and a daypack (I ended up getting a slingback, more on this later).   Even though I'm a regular online shopper, I opted for a real store where I could try out the backpacks.  I did not regret this decision.  

I also applied for the Schengen Visa to be able to travel to Europe.  Since I was not a US citizen yet, I had to apply for the Visa to be able to go to Europe.  My first destination was Paris, so I applied for the Visa at the French Consulate in downtown Chicago.  I applied for the Visa about 1 month ahead of the departure date, and after 3 weeks, I got my passport and Visa approved!

I bought the ticket about 1 week before the date, and surprisingly it was not that expensive.  Since I traveled in September, which is the end of the traveling season, when all the students are getting back to school.  I actually got lucked out, for the entire 3 weeks that I backpacked around, there was only one day in Amsterdam that it had a shower.  The rest was sunny, or cloudy at worst, making exploring the cities a joy!  I'd highly recommend September as your choice of traveling in Europe.  More reasons to follow later :)

For walking, I had a pair of North Face Padda.  (http://www.zappos.com/the-north-face-padda-black-sunburst-yellow or http://zapp.me/7364816).  The shoes are extremely light, I barely felt the weight, and the soles were very comfortable to walk in.  I probably walked on avarage 3 to 5 miles aday, if not more, for a straight 3 weeks.  My feet did hurt towards the end of the day, but it was not too bad that I couldn't walk the next day.  I was happy with this pair of shoes, and I'd highly recommend North Face and their products.  If something's worth spending money on on your trip, it is shoes and good backpacks.  Your feet and your back/shoulders will thank you, and you will be able to enjoy your trip a lot better, rather than struggling to just stand.

For packing ideas, I went online and did some researchs.  I bought 2 Eagle Creek packing cubes  and they served me amazingly well for the trip.  My main backpack was very well organized and I was able to fit 1-week worth of shirts, underwears, and socks into one single medium cube.  Plus the packing cube already compresses the items down, making the backpack quite stable and easy to carry.

I did not get the money belt, or money pouch to carry the money and the credit/debit cards.  I put my passport inside the slingbag, and my wallet in the front pants pocket.  I almost got pick-pocketted, but by putting the wallet in the front, I was able to detect the thief before he could do anything.  More on personal safety later.  Otherwise, Europe is quite safe and the people are very friendly.  Nonetheless, you should always watch for your own safety:  remember, it is about self-reliance, you know how to protect yourself the best.

What makes my guide difference is that I am a techie guy, a.k.a. a geek.  I have lots of gadgets, and this Europe trip I put them to the test.  I brought an iPhone 3G, an iPhone external charger using AA batteries, a Kindle DX, a Canon Rebel XSI dSLR camera, and no computer.  I intentially left the laptop home, even though I had a MacBook Air.  I'd rather spent a few Euros than constantly worrying about keeping the laptop safe.  And if I go on the next trip, I'd leave the Kindle DX home, since the iPhone is a lot more convenient, especially in small, crampy toilettes :).  I was able to facebook live most of my trip, never had to worry about the iPhone running out of juice, and never afraid of getting lost (except for one close call in Venice, Italy).  
For the first week and a half, I took almost 2,000 photos of chairs, buildings, people, friends, and less than 10 of myself.  But that's the joice of traveling by youself -- you are the observer, you are the one who studies the world with a curious pair of eyes.  For that, the journey alone is worth more than all the money you can spend on buying a big screen TV to watch the Travel Channel.

Money-wise I totally relied on one single source of cash:  my Chase Visa Debit card.  It was a bit risky, since you should have at least 2 sources of funding, in case one card doesn't work out (it happend to me at the very end of the trip, I was trying to pay for dinner but the card was rejected and my close friend ended up paying for )

During my down time, e.g. traveling on the train, or resting, I read and finished the book "The Art of Travel".  It was definitely an interesting read, and it did help me enjoy the trip more by becoming more open, more observant, and more self-aware (this was very important to me, since I was traveling by myself without a companion).  If you have time to do some readings, I'd recommend the book, however this is entirely optional as you may have a different reason or purpose of traveling, while I was traveling to find mine.
