If you want your own private bathtub with running hot waters and candle light, you may have to re-think your backpacking trip a bit.  But if you don't mind taking a quick standing shower in a crampy box, then staying in a hostel  is a affordable way to enjoy your traveling.  You will be sharing a room with other people from all over the world, which makes you realize that the world is pretty huge.  You may strike a conversation, and from that, a new friendship is born.  Your new-found enemies are bed bugs and to a lesser degree, people's snoring while you are trying to fall asleep after a long day.    But trust me, after all is said and done, hostels really do make the backpacking trip a more interesting memory.

I was a bit lucky for my trip, as it turned out, I had friends and long-lost relatives in the cities that I planned to travel.  I was able to crash at their place for the majority of the trip.  Nonetheless, I stayed in hostels when I was in Amsterdam, Venice, and Rome.  I made new friends at all the places.  


For the hostels I stayed, they have about 4 to 9 beds in a room.  


Finding and booking
===================
Most hostels now have online websites, or online reservation forms.  You should be able to Google around the available options for the city you are heading.  Sometimes, the online service will charge a few more euros for the booking fee, which adds up to the room fee.  The rate is ranging from 25€ to 40€ per night, and even though I've heard of cheaper rates of 15€.

You can use your Visa or Master card to place a reservation, but most places will ask you to pay cash for the room.  If you stay for more than a few nights, it doesn't hurt to ask the reception for a discount.  Checking-in is usually very simple.  You fill out a form, they check your ID or passport, then you pay.  Voila, you'll be crashing on your bed in a few minutes.  But you know you will be out on the streets right after.  Who has time to sleep?

Sleeping and bathing
====================
Most hostels have shared rooms.  If you travel in a group, you maybe able to be get a private room for a bit more money.  It's a trade-off, your privacy or your money.  Places I stayed have from 4 to 8 beds in a room.  Usually I was given a clean sheet to use as blanket.  The beds were okay, at least I did not wake up and felt like my back was snapped in half.  

Going backpacking means you will have to sleep simply, and preferably before other people to avoid suffering from other people snoring.  After a day of walking and traveling, most people will sleep very soundly, literaly.  I was once sleeping in a bed between 2 other people.  It was like a concert of snoring, in stereo, with both of them taking turn with every breath.  I was up till 4:00AM.

You will also find yourself in dark room full of people sleeping and their stuff on the floor, together with your own.  A small flashlight will come handy.  LED ones are fine since they are small, compact, and quite bright, and cost only a few bucks at the store.  I bought a cord-lock LED light by Black Crater (http://www.rei.com/product/780350).  It barely weight anything (0.3oz, or 8g) and I attached it to the main cord, giving me an extra tightening stop for the backpack.  

Towel is optional, so having one of your own comes very handy.  Towel usually takes time to dry up, so if you carry a regular towel with you, and the hostel offers free towel, then use theirs so that you can keep your stuff dry.  And don't forget to bring a towel with you to the bathroom.  I had to walk out all wet once, since I was so used to having my towel already in the bathroom.  It was like living in a college dorm all over again.

If possible, you should also look for a bed with a strategic location to the outlet.  You will have to charge your phone, your cameras, your iPod, and other gadgets.  Being close to the outlet means you can keep an eye on your toys better.


Enjoy the experience safely
===========================
You will lose your privacy, and you should always be aware of your important belongings:  wallet, money, passport, and other documents.  You start a conversation, then someone stops by your bed to talk.  Next thing you know, your wallet is gone, and so is that someone, whose name you barely know.  Be friendly and approachable, but trust noone.  Your goal should be to take care of yourself and be 100% self-reliant, and with that said, always keep an alerted eye.  Luckily, most people are honest and friendly.  They have to worry about the same thing as you do.

I put my wallet deep underneath the pillow where my head is.  I only sleep in one posture: up right, and I never move during the night.  4 years of college has trained me of not rolling off the beds, since that can be an unpleasant fall 6 feet off the ground.  If anybody tries to reach in to steal something, I'd be able to feel their presence.  But the most effective way is to tell yourself and your subconscious mind that you need to be alerted, even during sleep.  You are now in the middle of the wild world, with unknown risks and dangers.  You will find that your subconscious mind will work in your favor to protect yourself.  

You should ask the hostel for free locker to store the baggage, or at least your important documents.  Remember to bring a combo lock so that you don't have to waste time securing one.  Some hostels try to sell you the lock, some let you borrow it with some deposit (usually 10€).  And in the case the hostel does not have free lockers, hHaving your own lock means you can even secure the backpack even.  The goal is to be 100% self-reliant, right?

You should also keep your footprint as small as possible, e.g. clean up, re-pack any loose items right away.  The only 2 things I lost during the trip were my toothbrush (forgot in Amsterdam), and my cap (forgot on the plane flying home to O'Hare).  Both times, I did not follow the "minimal foot-print" principle.  If you actively take care of your belongings, the chance of you forgetting something is much less.  The consequence of forgetting makes your trip less enjoyable.  Imagine what happens if you forget the camera's charger, or the phone charger.  Do yourself a favor and before going to bed, put everything back into the backpack, and secure it if necessary.  And before you leave, perform a mental and visual check of the room:  underneath your bed, under the pillow and blanket, area close to the outlet, your wallet, your passport, etc..  There is no room, literally, for errors.

Bed bugs
========
Bed bugs deserve their own subheading.  As I'm writing this guide, I'm still suffering from them a week after getting back.  They are the MOST annoying enemies of your trip.   


My experiences
==============

My room in Amsterdam smelled like crap.  Probably it had been a smoking room before the no-smoking-inside law was passed.  I stayed at a place called "Win Hostel", which is a direct affiliate with HotelRunner.  If Amsterdam is in your list of places to visit (you should), then it's advisable to book the hotel a head of time, especially you are to arrive at the weekend.  During busy time, you may get the response of "we're full", got panicked, and jump on the first hostel that have rooms, even with a higher rate.  Essentially your chance of getting a cheap place to stay is reduced to the first hostels that still have vacancy.
