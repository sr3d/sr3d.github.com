Most countries in Europe weren't built 200 years ago like the States, so the cities weren't designed for lots of car traffic.  Trains, trams, metro패, buses, and walking become an intergral parts of Europeans' daily life.  As a backpacker, you will have the chance to have a taste of this lifestyle for a few days.  So get yourself a ticket, a Metro패 map, and get going.  

Metro패
=====
All the metro systems are pretty well designed.  Some can be overwhelmd at first, such as Paris's system, but other can be fairly small, e.g. Rome's.  Being a fearless and adventurous traveler, navigating yourself through the first time should be a fun challenge.  Essentially all train lines have two destinations:  point A to point B.  In between, there are lots of stops, and stations where you are able to switch to other lines.  Maps are usually available freely and you can always ask people for direction.  

The best way to read the metro map is to have the general city map in your head so that you can compare the two maps paralelly.  Find out where you want to go and locate the closest Metro station around.  From there, trace back to your nearest metro station to hop on.  Account for all the train-switching in between, as there can be multiple ways to get to your destination.

My first day in Europe was in Paris.  I was supposed to meet up with my friend that day, but she was out of town till later in the afternoon.  I had a Metro map, a Paris Visite패 train pass, and a day to see Paris.  Traveling by myself means that I had to teach myself of how to get lost and find my way back.  I could decide instantly where I wanted to go and hop on the train to get there. I've been to Montreal, Canada a few times before, and their Metro system is very similar to that of Paris.  The only trouble I had was to pronouce the places the French way.  Frenchies have their own way of saying things, so I adjusted my ears to listen to the announcements on the speakers, and to familiarize myself with the stops.

Tickets
Most cities offer a day-pass, which you can use to get on all the public transportations.  The most expensive system so far is Paris, with the zone 1-6 tickets costs 18.50E.  Nonetheless, once you are familiar with the syste, you can find the best and cheapest way to get around.  

Metro as a way of life
I have to admit, all metro systems that I used have smells.  It's the smells of people's sweats, body odors, perfumes, deodorant, train oils, and countless other things.  I think if something defines the urban's life, it's the smell.

Coming for the US, where almost everyone has a little car to drive from home to work with minimal sharing of public spaces, being in such a close proximity with others suddenly makes me feel human again.
